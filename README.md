# Basal metabolic rate (BMR) calculator

### What is BMR?

BMR is a minimum number of calories required for basic functions at rest.
If you are on diet you should never cut your calories under the BMR level.
This is the minimum your body needs to survive.

### Goals of this small project

It's obvious! I wanted to learn something about TypeScript. Now I know how powerful this tool can be.

### What I have learned:

1. Adding types seemingly making our work longer, but in consequence make it shorter - debugging is mutch mutch easier.
2. Visual Studio Code - my favourite code editor, under the hood uses TypeScript.
3. TypeScript can catch errors and provide fixes before you even run code.
4. TypeScript compiler generate .js file with is already transpiled - no classes ect. It's really useful.

#### I ran and tested a code with node.js
